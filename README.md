# JawasChallenge

The application is inspired by the idea of Jawas, characters that traded electronic gadgets in Star Wars. The proposal is to transform obsolete devices into non-profit jewelry and trinkets. The application includes:

Registration of companies as collaborators to donate obsolete material.
Classifier users disassemble and classify donated pieces.
Administrators manage users and types of gadgets.
Designer users create jewelry with classified components.
Companies indicate lots to donate and their location through Google Maps.
Classifiers dismantle lots and classify components.
Administrators manage users and types of hardware.
Designers manage CRUD of jewelry with ingredients and reference photos.
Designers check component availability to make jewelry.
Parametrizable random jewelry generator.
